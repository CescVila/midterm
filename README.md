Mid-Term Project has been my first project at IRONHACK frontend bootcamp. In this project I've learned how to do a Website where you can interact through a contact form, where u can get acces to diferent projects and where you can get information from a data base meanwhile using diferent lenguages. This website is a copy of https://circle-agency-35d27e.webflow.io/ 

The diferent technologies thet I use during the proces are:

HTML
CSS
Javascript
